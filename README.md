Laboratory Team Exercise 1.2

-Generate the matrices A, B, C and D using the Matlab command tf2ss. Select a transfer function of a 2nd order system (e.g. PT2).

-Develop an m-file which represents the linear differential equations with constant coefficients shown above. Implement a suitable integration algorithm, do not use the built-in lsim() command. Take possible initial values into account.

-Excite the systems with a step and an adequate frequency-sweep input.

-Compare your approach with the State Space Block given in the Simulink library and show, that the outputs are identical.

-Generate characteristic plots for the report using the Matlab plot command.

-Write a technical report where the above mentioned tasks are described and the results
are discussed.
